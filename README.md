## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

As i did not know how to use "flex" property yet, it was hard work to finish this simple challenge. Stil learning.

```css
.display: flex
```

### Continued development

I am still not comfortable with "flexbox" property but i want to refine and perfect my knowledge.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me to understand a little bit more.I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
